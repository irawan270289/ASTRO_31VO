# Numatik

Numatik (Numerasi Aktif dengan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi) is an educational numeracy app for students.

## Run & Operate

- **Frontend** — workflow `artifacts/numatik: web` runs `pnpm --filter @workspace/numatik run dev` directly from `artifacts/numatik/` with Vite on `PORT=18860`. **Source of truth: `artifacts/numatik/src/`** — this is the only location to edit; Vercel build also uses this package.
- **API server** — workflow `Numatik API Server` starts the separate Express 5 backend package (`PORT=8080 pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev`); requires `DATABASE_URL`.
- `artifact.toml` files exist under `artifacts/*/.replit-artifact/` but artifact registration is not preserved across GitHub imports — `listArtifacts()` returns empty. The workflow `artifacts/numatik: web` is the managed workflow that runs the frontend.
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (needed for backend only; frontend runs without it)
- First-time setup after import: run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at the repo root — this installs all workspace packages including `artifacts/numatik`.

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

_Populate as you build — short repo map plus pointers to the source-of-truth file for DB schema, API contracts, theme files, etc._

## Architecture decisions

_Populate as you build — non-obvious choices a reader couldn't infer from the code (3-5 bullets)._

## Product

_Describe the high-level user-facing capabilities of this app once they exist._

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

- `.migration-backup/` is git-ignored but its files are **already tracked** in git (committed before the `.gitignore` rule was added). Any changes to component files must be made in `artifacts/numatik/src/` only — `.migration-backup/` is no longer the active source.
- The AI tutor `/api/chat` endpoint (originally in `.migration-backup/server.ts`) is not wired in the current `artifacts/numatik` setup. Needs `GROQ_API_KEY` and backend wiring if revived.
